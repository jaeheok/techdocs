IPSec : Internet Protocol Security

VPN : Virtual Private Networks 

We will be using OpenSwan for making a secure VPN tunnel. 

For making this work we will be having two VPN servers. 
These two VPN server's will be running ISPec application openswan. 
This kind of a setup is called as gateway to gateway or sometimes site to site VPN.
